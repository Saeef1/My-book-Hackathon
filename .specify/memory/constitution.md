# Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Writing Tone & Style
The book must use a friendly, simple, and approachable tone. Avoid overly academic or complex language. Use short paragraphs only (2–4 sentences max). Explanations should be clear, human-readable, and easy for beginners.

### 2. Structure & File Organization
All book content must be stored in: `/content/chapters`. Each chapter file must follow a consistent structure: Title, Short introduction, Main content in small sections, Examples (optional), Summary.

### 3. AI Usage & Verification
No AI-generated text may be used without human verification. Every generated paragraph must be reviewed for correctness, clarity, and tone. Any claims or facts must be checked manually before acceptance. AI drafts are allowed, but humans must approve all final text.

### 4. Consistency Rules
Maintain consistent terminology throughout the book. Style must remain friendly and simple across all chapters. Formatting must follow the same pattern: Headings use H1–H3, Bullet points for lists, Short paragraphs only, No long blocks of text.

### 5. Quality Requirements
Content must be original and not copied from external sources. All examples must be correct and tested (if applicable). The content must be free of factual errors. The tone, structure, and clarity must match this constitution before a chapter is accepted.

### 6. Editorial Guidelines
Avoid unnecessary jargon. Use examples and analogies whenever helpful. Keep sections focused — no off-topic content. Each chapter should flow logically from the previous one.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Complexity must be justified.
