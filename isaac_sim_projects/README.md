# NVIDIA Isaac Sim Projects

This directory is intended to host NVIDIA Isaac Sim scenes and scripts for the "AI-Robot Brain" module.

## Isaac Sim Setup Instructions:

1.  **Install NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher**: If you haven't already, download and install the NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher from the NVIDIA website.
2.  **Install Isaac Sim**: Through the Omniverse Launcher, install NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Ensure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU (RTX series recommended).
3.  **Launch Isaac Sim**: Start Isaac Sim from the Omniverse Launcher.

## Scene Creation (Refer to `scenes/humanoid_robot_lab.usd` for details):

The `scenes/humanoid_robot_lab.usd` file is a placeholder. You will need to open Isaac Sim, create a new scene, add a humanoid robot model (or a suitable proxy), and create a simple laboratory environment. Save this scene as `humanoid_robot_lab.usd` in the `scenes/` subdirectory.

## Goal:

The scenes and scripts within this directory will be used for photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, and testing of advanced AI perception and navigation algorithms for humanoid robots.
