# Humanoid Robot Lab Scene (Placeholder)

This file (`humanoid_robot_lab.usd`) is a placeholder for an NVIDIA Isaac Sim scene.

## Setup Instructions:

1.  **Open NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Launch Isaac Sim.
2.  **Create a New Scene**: Start with a new, empty stage or load a suitable template.
3.  **Add a Humanoid Robot Model**:
    *   Navigate to the Omniverse Asset Library or your local asset repository.
    *   Import a humanoid robot model (e.g., "Franka Emika Panda" if you are using it as a proxy for a humanoid, or a specific humanoid model if available).
    *   Position the robot in the scene.
4.  **Create a Simple Environment**:
    *   Add a ground plane, some walls, and simple obstacles to create a basic laboratory-like environment.
    *   Ensure the environment is suitable for navigation and object interaction.
5.  **Save the Scene**: Save your newly created scene as `humanoid_robot_lab.usd` within this `isaac_sim_projects/scenes/` directory.

## Goal:

This scene will serve as the primary simulation environment for Module 3, providing a photorealistic setting for advanced perception, training, and navigation tasks with the humanoid robot.
